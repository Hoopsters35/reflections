How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Being able to see the two files side by side made it very easy to spot differences or bugs
that would have been nearly impossible in the entire files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having easy access to all versions of my file would make it much easier to clean up bugs that occur
while patching new bugs. As I could see why things worked before and why they don't now

Why do some VCS only save one file while others save all files
in coding you need every file to work together, but in another project the files may be irrelevant to eachother

use git log to find the id's and commit messages, then use git diff to find differences
